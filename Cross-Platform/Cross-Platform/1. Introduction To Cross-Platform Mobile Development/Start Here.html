        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is a cross-platform class which has projects for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8. To complete the coding exercise for this class, you will need either a Windows or OS X setup, or both to use all three platforms. Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This class introduces how to create solutions that have multiple platform targeted applications and how to maximize code sharing between them using two techniques: Shared Projects and Portable Class Libraries.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Working with Shared Components</li>
            <li>Using Shared Projects</li>
            <li>Using Portable Class Libraries</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="hintblock">
            To demonstrate the cross-platform nature of Xamarin, all the exercises include projects for iOS, Android and Windows Phone in the solutions. You can pick one of more of these platforms to test with as long as you have the SDKs installed. Keep in mind that in order to set the active project, you may need to change the build type - for example, iOS projects should use the Debug|iPhoneSimulator build. If you are trying to change the startup project and the option is unavailable, it is very likely because the project is not supported for the active build type.
        </div>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><div class="objective">Working with Shared Projects</div>
            <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            One way to share code across platforms is to compile the same source files into each project. In this exercise, we will examine sharing code at the source-level with the new Shared Project feature in Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Working with Portable Class Libraries</div>
            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            A completely different style of code sharing is to share assemblies between projects - in this section, we will look at Portable Class Libraries and how to use them effectively in your projects to maximize the amount of code we can share.

            In this class, we use <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/">Shared Projects</a> as a technique of sharing source code. However, there is an older technique we are not covering which is also available if you cannot use shared projects. Check out <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306234">File Linking in Visual Studio</a> if you are interested.
